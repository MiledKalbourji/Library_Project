    <h1>Welcome, Ladies and Gentlemen, to My Library Project!</h1>

    <p>
        Over the last 4 months, I have explored the patterns of students coming in and out of Addams Library.
        Each day, the library staff collects data every hour of every day, every week, every month, every year.
    </p>

    <h2>Point of the Project:</h2>
    <p>
        I want to give the Library a greater importance than "old books." I want to prove the importance of Addams Library
        as a hub for students to gather, share information, and relax.
    </p>

    <h3>How is the Project Going to Prove This?</h3>
    <p>
        Based on the foot traffic throughout the years, months, and weeks, we can use hard data to see a recovery
        from 2020 â€” the worst economic year for any industry.
    </p> 

    <h3> What is this data</h3> 
    <p> 
    This data is based upon the number of public, and students that inside in the library. These paterons could be doing homework, talking to there friends, having study groups, and more importantly learning about there future. 
 Here, at Addams library we pretty consistent in taking the headcount. </p>

    <p>Click a button to view an image of the raw data I collected. As well each  image has its own description to highlight  the importance of this data. </p>
